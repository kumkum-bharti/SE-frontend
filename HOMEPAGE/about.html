        <h1>Welcome to Jet Cart Stay</h1>
        <p>The revolutionary app you never knew you needed but now can’t live without (probably).</p>
        <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
        <p>Oh, just a bunch of people who thought, "Why not make another web app?" Because clearly, the internet was running low on those.</p>
        <h2>What Do We Do?</h2>
        <p>We connect people with places, carts with stays, and expectations with reality (sort of). Need a stay? A cart? A stay with a cart (why?)—we might have you covered.</p>
        <h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>
        <p>
            Because your friend said, "Just try it, bro!"<br>
            Because you enjoy clicking buttons and seeing things happen.<br>
            Because our homepage already explained everything, and now we’re just here for entertainment.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>To make an app so seamless that even your WiFi can't keep up.</p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>To exist. To function (mostly). To pretend we have a mission.</p>
        <p>Still reading? Wow. You must really care. Go on, explore the site—you might just surprise yourself.</p>
