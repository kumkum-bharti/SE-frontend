    Welcome to Jet Cart Stay—the revolutionary app you never knew you needed but now can’t live without (probably).<br>

Who Are We?
Oh, just a bunch of people who thought, "Why not make another web app?" Because clearly, the internet was running low on those.<br>

What Do We Do?
We connect people with places, carts with stays, and expectations with reality (sort of). Whether you need a stay or a cart, or a stay with a cart (why?), we might have you covered.<br>

Why Choose Us?
Because your friend said, "Just try it, bro!"<br>

Because you enjoy clicking buttons and seeing things happen.<br>

Because our homepage already explained everything, and now we’re just here for entertainment.

Our Vision
To make an app so seamless that even your WiFi can't keep up.

Our Mission
To exist. To function (mostly). To pretend we have a mission.

Still reading? Wow. You must really care. Go on, explore the site—you might just surprise yourself.
